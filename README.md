# Keras-Deeplearning-Quarantine-Project-Part1

I worked on this project to brush up my skills in Keras. 
Wrote all the code from scratch and trained multi class deeplearning model end to end on 10 class image dataset.
Primary focus was to achieve a better accuracy. I tried achieving as high accuracy as possible by tweaking Model architecture and
playing with hyperparameters. I focused not to use transfer learning for it and achieve highaccuracy just by aforementioned criterias.

Accuracy achieved - 82.8%
